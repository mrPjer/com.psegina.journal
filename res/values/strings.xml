		<i>(There are many reasons as to why one should keep a journal. In case you want to read up
		on this, there is a great article on journalling here : http://ririanproject.com/2006/09/22/10-reasons-to-keep-a-journal)</i>\nThis 
		app is meant to provide you with a small and flexible notepad into which you can input your thoughts, observations
		and important events. Giving you the ability to write entries from anywhere in your phone by long-pressing the search button, 
		you can now record thoughts on the fly. And to make sure that things do not get messy, you can tag entries so that entries that 
		have common content (for example those that could be grouped under <i>jokes</i>) can be read in a single thread simply by clicking
		on one of the entries.\nWith 
		this app you can keep track of important things in your life, get better insight into your own thoughts and quickly type down things 
		that you would usually forget.
